if the domain of text is dealing with "Artificial Intelligence", then this is a term that's worthy of consideration because it's a term that's used in a book that an AVERAGE person doesn't have prior knowledge about.
subsequently, if the term "Neural Network" is mentioned in the chapter summaries and part of that chapter's summary, then you must include this term.
